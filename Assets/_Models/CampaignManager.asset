  intro:
  - 'Happy election day, Mr. [Name]! Today''s our last day on the campaign, and we
    are neck and neck with the opposition. It''s time to go bang down some doors. '
  - Our research has found the 3 neighborhoods with the most undecided voters. Open
    your dossier to read details for each voter and form your plan of attack.
  - 'We live in a diverse city, and our citizens don''t agree on every policy topic.
    It might be wise to pay attention to who your talking to when you make your promises. '
  - Getting the right tone for the person is also vital! Remember, politics is about
    how you say something as much as what you say.
  - If the voter seems on the fence, you can try greasing their wheels a bit, if
    you know what I mean. Our campaign funds are running dry though, so don't spend
    it all in one place!
  - 'Hit the streets and report back to me after each neighborhood to review early
    polling data. '
  - Good luck, Mr. [Name]. Or should I say, future Mr. Mayor?

    - 'You''re on fire, [Name]! Early voting data is in and you are in the lead!
      Keep that energy going. '
    losingDialog:
    - 'We may want to rethink our strategy, you''re starting to trail in the polls. '
    - Make sure to review the dossier for each citizen. That will help you understand
      which proposals they may favor.
  - winningDialog:
    - 'You''re pulling ahead! We might just cross this finish line. '
    losingDialog:
    - Numbers are not looking so hot so far. Maybe try and be more... relatable?
    - Don't worry, reading people is hard. Here's a trick. If someone responds well
      to something, stick with it.
  - winningDialog:
    - You did it, Mr. Mayor-elect! The Polls are in and show a decisive victory.
      Four more years!
    losingDialog:
    - I'm afraid I don't have good news. The opposition has cleared 50%, and the
      race is over. Maybe we can try again next term?
